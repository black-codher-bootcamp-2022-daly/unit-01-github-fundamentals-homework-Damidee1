# Git and Github Basics.

Git is a distributed version control system. it is to track changes and also keep a record of this changes. Also a great for collaboration.
You do not need GitHub to use git, but you cannot use GitHub without using git.

### Some of the terms i have learnt are;

- Repositories
- Cloning
- Fork
- Push and Commiting
- Pull Requests

#### Things i'm still struggling with which i know will get better once i practice very well;

- Using the correct git command in terminal
- Pushing to the right place and remembring to create a branch for my repositories.
- understanding how to merge files on git
